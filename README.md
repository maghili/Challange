# Pharmacy-Counting

The code uses `set` to find the unique drug names and then creates a list that contains a list with the name of the drug, count of that drug and the acumulated price. Finally the result is being sorted and the values ase passed out to a textfile.
This process has a O(n^3/2) time complexity.
