# Pharmacy-Counting

The code uses `set` to find the unique drug names and then creates a list that contains a list with the name of the drug, count of that drug and the acumulated price. I used dictionaries to remove the extra amount of time expense. Finally the result is put in a list and is sorted which has some logarithmic expense in time but in general will not add too much to overall expnse. At the values ase passed out to a textfile.
This process has a O(n) time complexity.
